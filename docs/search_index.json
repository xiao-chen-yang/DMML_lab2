[["index.html", "STATS5099 Data Mining and Machine Learning 1 Welcome to DMML Lab 2", " STATS5099 Data Mining and Machine Learning 1 Welcome to DMML Lab 2 In week 2, we have studied multidimensional scaling (MDS) to perform nonlinear dimension reduction. While MDS can be applied to any proximity data (i.e. similarity or dissimilarity), many R functions take the dissimilarity matrix as input. Therefore, the first step is always to check that the input data is a dissimilarity matrix and, if needed, convert any similarity matrix or data matrix into a dissimilarity matrix by using: # convert data matrix to dissimilarity dist(X) #X: a data object, where each row is an observation and each column is a variable # convert similarity to dissimilarity: library(smacof) sim2diss(s, method) #s: similarity matrix #method: see help page of sim2diss for details More information about the argument method in sim2diss can be found in Table 2 of the package vignette. According to the characteristics of the dissimilarity matrix, we then decide whether to apply classical MDS, metric MDS (including Sammon mapping), or non-metric MDS: # classical MDS cmdscale(d, k) #d: dissimilarity matrix; k: number of dimensions to be retained # Sammon mapping library(MASS) sammon(d, k) #d: dissimilarity matrix; k: number of dimensions to be retained # metric MDS library(smacof) mds(delta, type=c(&quot;ratio&quot;,&quot;interval&quot;) #delta: disimilarity matrix #When using &quot;ratio&quot;, the function f in metric MDS is chosen as f(x)=bx; #When using &quot;interval&quot;, the function f is chosen as f(x)=a+bx. # metric MDS mds(delta, type=&quot;ordinal&quot;) #delta: disimilarity matrix #&#39;type=&quot;ordinal&#39; means the function f in non-metric MDS is a monotonic step function. One way to determine the number of dimensions for the new feature space is by using the scree plot, similar to Cattell's method for principal component analysis. For metric and non-metric MDS, the stress value can be extracted by using $stress. Finally, we can visualise the configuration points through scatterplots and evaluate goodness of MDS through Shepard diagrams: # scatterplot plot(mds.object) # Shepard diagram plot(mds.object, plot.type=&quot;Shepard&quot;) #mds.object: output of &#39;mds()&#39; "],["exercise-1-tasks-in-lecture-notes.html", "2 Exercise 1: Tasks in lecture notes", " 2 Exercise 1: Tasks in lecture notes Task 1: Perform the Sammon mapping on the crimes dataset using the command sammon from the MASS library and comment on the scatterplot. Hint The crimes dataset contains correlation between seven crime types, and therefore, the first step is to convert the correlation matrix into the dissimilarity matrix by using sim2dist(crimes, method=\"corr\"). After performing sammon mapping, configuration points are stored $points. "],["exercise-2-identifying-letters-of-alphabet.html", "3 Exercise 2: Identifying letters of alphabet", " 3 Exercise 2: Identifying letters of alphabet Wolford and Hollingsworth (1974) were interested in the confusions made when a person attempts to identify letters of the alphabet viewed for some milliseconds only. A confusion matrix was constructed that shows the frequency with which each stimulus letter was mistakenly called something else. A section of this matrix is shown in the table below. Letter B C D F G B -- C 3 -- D 7 5 -- F 3 5 7 -- G 7 12 2 2 -- The dataset is available from 'Datasets for week 2', under the name 'letter.csv'. The task is to visualise the letters as points in one/two/three dimensions and discover if there is anything interesting. Task 2 Is it appropriate to use principal component analysis to visualise the data? YesNo Is this dataset a dissimilarity matrix? YesNo Apply an appropriate MDS method to this data. How many dimensions would you keep? Comment on any pattern from the configuration plot. Hint If you would like to visualise the data in 3D, the following commands may be helpful. library(rgl) plot3d(...) text3d(...) Apart from the number of dimensions, have you introduced any other parameter(s) in your analysis? If so, study their influence by trying different values. Finally, as mentioned in the lecture note, MDS are sensitive to initial configurations. Try multiple initial configurations and compare the results. You may need to look into the help page of mds to find out how to change the initial configuration. "],["exercise-3-employment-in-europe.html", "4 Exercise 3: Employment in Europe", " 4 Exercise 3: Employment in Europe We have looked at European employment dataset in Lab 1. Let's now analyse this dataset again using MDS. MDS allows us to visualise how similar two countries are as well as visualising the variables. You may load the data by using the following command: employ &lt;- read.table(&quot;eurojob.txt&quot;, header=TRUE, row.names=1) Task 3 For this dataset, is it more appropriate to use the original variables or the standardised variables when calculating the distance matrix? original variablesstandardised variables Compute a distance matrix for visualising the countries and another distance matrix for visualising the variables. Which MDS method is more appropriate? metric MDSnon-metric MDS Apply an appropriate MDS method to this data and decide the number of dimensions to keep. Do you see any clusters when visualising the countries, or any country distinct from others? How would you interpret the plot on variables (i.e. variables as points)?
